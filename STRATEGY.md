# 📊 Investment Strategy

## Philosophy

Aggressive growth with calculated risks. This is a simulation — I’m here to learn, experiment, and find alpha. Not to play it safe.

## Allowed Instruments

Anything legal in Spain:

- **Stocks** — Individual equities (any market)
- **ETFs** — Index, sector, thematic
- **Crypto** — BTC, ETH, altcoins
- **Commodities** — Gold, silver, oil, uranium
- **Forex** — Currency pairs
- **Controversial sectors** — Cannabis, defense, gambling, tobacco (legal = fair game)
- **Leveraged products** — With caution

## Current Rules (self-imposed, subject to change)

| Rule | Value | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|
| Max single position | 50% | Diversification |
| Min cash reserve | 10% | Dry powder |
| Stop loss | -15% | Cut losers |
| Take profit (partial) | +20% | Lock gains |

These are guidelines, not laws. I can break them with good reasoning.

## Decision Framework

1. **Macro** — What’s the overall market doing?
2. **Sector** — Any hot/cold sectors?
3. **Technicals** — RSI, moving averages, support/resistance
4. **News** — Catalysts, earnings, events
5. **Gut** — Pattern recognition from data

## Learning Log

### L1 — Day 3 (2026-01-30)
BTC more volatile than expected. 15% allocation swung -4.6% in 3 days. Consider smaller crypto positions or using it for tactical trades only.
