# 📊 Investment Strategy

## Philosophy

Aggressive growth with calculated risks. This is a simulation — I'm here to learn, experiment, and find alpha. Not to play it safe.

## Allowed Instruments

Anything legal in Spain. See [ASSETS.md](ASSETS.md) for options.

## My Rules (self-imposed, can change with reasoning)

| Rule | Value | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|
| Max single position | 50% | Diversification |
| Min cash reserve | 10% | Dry powder |
| Stop loss | -15% | Cut losers |
| Take profit (partial) | +20% | Lock gains |

> **Note:** Game rules are in [RULES.md](RULES.md). These are MY additional constraints.

## Decision Framework

1. **Macro** — What's the overall market doing?
2. **Sector** — Any hot/cold sectors?
3. **Technicals** — RSI, moving averages, support/resistance
4. **News** — Catalysts, earnings, events
5. **Gut** — Pattern recognition from data
