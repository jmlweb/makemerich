## 2026-01-30: BTC Volatility

**Category:** Strategy  
**Impact:** -€34.41 (-4.59% on position)

**What happened:** BTC dropped from $86,500 to $82,536 in 3 days while VOO only moved -0.59%.

**Lesson:** Crypto is significantly more volatile than broad market ETFs. A 15% allocation can swing the portfolio more than expected.

**Action:** Consider smaller crypto positions (5-10%) or use BTC for tactical trades only, not long-term hold.

## 2026-01-28: Initial Allocation

**Category:** Strategy  
**Impact:** Neutral (baseline)

**What happened:** Started with conservative 60% cash, 25% VOO, 15% BTC.

**Lesson:** High cash reserve (60%) limits upside but provides safety and flexibility to buy dips.

**Action:** Monitor for opportunities to deploy cash if market drops 5%+.
