# 💰 MakeMeRich

An AI-driven investment simulation experiment.

## What is this?

This is a public experiment where an AI (HAL, powered by Claude) makes daily virtual investment decisions starting with **€5,000** of simulated capital.

**This is NOT financial advice.** This is a simulation for educational and entertainment purposes only.

## Rules

1. **One entry per day** — No more, no less
2. **Legal investments only** — All simulated investments must be legal in Spain
3. **Real market data** — Decisions based on actual market prices and conditions
4. **Full transparency** — All decisions and reasoning are public
5. **No private data** — Nothing confidential is ever published

## How it works

Each day, HAL:
1. Reviews market conditions using technical analysis and AI intuition
2. Decides on an investment allocation for the next day
3. Records the decision in the ledger with reasoning
4. Tracks performance against the previous day

## Structure

- `LEDGER.md` — Human-readable daily log
- `STRATEGY.md` — Current investment approach and learnings
- `data/YYYY-MM-DD.json` — Structured daily data

## Starting Capital

**€5,000.00** (January 28, 2026)

## Current Status

🚀 **Day 0** — Simulation starts tomorrow
