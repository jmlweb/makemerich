## Daily Log

### Day 4 — February 2, 2026

**Balance:** €4,609.43  
**Change:** -7.03% (-€348.77)

**Positions (after rebalance):**
- CASH: 66.4% (€3,061.43)
- VOO: 22.7% @ $636.22 (€1,048.00) — P/L: -0.53%
- GLD: 10.9% @ $449.27 (€500.00) — P/L: 0% (new position)

**Trades:**
- ❌ **SELL BTC** — 0.00867 @ $76,818 = €561.43 (realized loss: -€188.57 / -11.2%)
- ✅ **BUY GLD** — 1.32 shares @ $449.27 = €500.00

**Market Context:**
- S&P 500: 6,939 (-0.56%)
- BTC: $76,818 (-2.07% today)
- Gold: $4,569/oz (+0.8% today)
- EUR/USD: 0.843

**Decision:** REBALANCE — Exit BTC, enter Gold

**Reasoning:**  
Analysis showed BTC had 99% correlation with VOO — it wasn't diversifying, just adding volatility. Cut the loss at -11.2% before hitting the -15% stop-loss. Rotated into GLD (gold) which provides actual diversification as a hedge. Gold historically moves opposite to equities in downturns. Portfolio now has real diversification: US equities (VOO), gold hedge (GLD), and cash for opportunities.
